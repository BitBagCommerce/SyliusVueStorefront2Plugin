## Overview

This plugin allows you to expose all critical models and operations as graphql queries and mutations<br />
It uses api-platform with xml mappings for models
It also handles JWT communication

To check automatically generated API Doc for graphql in Your project - visit one of following endpoints.

```
  api_graphql_entrypoint              /api/v2/graphql                                                                   
  api_graphql_graphiql                /api/v2/graphql/graphiql                                                          
  api_graphql_graphql_playground      /api/v2/graphql/graphql_playground
```

Please note that many of used functions and approaches both on Sylius and API Platform with Graphql support are still marked as experimental.

**This plugin is needed, if you want to integrate Sylius with Vue Storefront 2.
Please check out the awesome frontend integration package from our Realtainment friends to make it happen: https://github.com/RealtainmentBerlin/vuestorefront-sylius**

### Requirements

The plugin uses following 3rd party 


`"sylius/sylius": "^1.10"` as it supports API Platform from that version<br />
`"webonyx/graphql-php": at stable version`<br />
`"gesdinet/jwt-refresh-token-bundle"` for logging purposes
