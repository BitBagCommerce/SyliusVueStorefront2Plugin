## Overview

This plugin allows you to integrate Sylius backend with [Vue Storefront 2 integration](https://github.com/BitBagCommerce/SyliusVueStorefront2Frontend).

This plugin allows you to expose all critical models and operations as graphql queries and mutations<br />
It unlocks graphql-based API on top of ApiPlatform and JWT.

To check automatically generated GraphQL API Doc for your Vue Storefront 2 application - visit one of the following endpoints.

```
  api_graphql_entrypoint              /api/v2/graphql                                                                   
  api_graphql_graphiql                /api/v2/graphql/graphiql                                                          
  api_graphql_graphql_playground      /api/v2/graphql/graphql_playground
```

Please note that many of used functions and approaches both on Sylius and API Platform with Graphql support are still marked as experimental.
