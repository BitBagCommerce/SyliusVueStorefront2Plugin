    Scenario: Placing order
        When I prepare query to fetch all products
        And I send that GraphQL request as authorised user
        Then I should receive a JSON response
        And I save key 'collection.0.variants.collection.0.id' of this response as "firstProductVariantIri"
        And I save key 'collection.1.variants.collection.0.id' of this response as "secondProductVariantIri"

        When I prepare create cart operation
