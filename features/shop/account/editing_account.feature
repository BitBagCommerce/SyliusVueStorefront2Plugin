    As a Customer

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And there is a customer "Francis Underwood" identified by an email "francis@underwood.com" and a password "whitehouse"
        And I create a JWT Token for customer identified by an email "francis@underwood.com"
# commented until functionality is fixed / implemented
#    @graphql
#    Scenario: Editing account

#        And I set IRI of this customer request to match "francis@underwood.com"

#        And I want to be subscribed to newsletter

#        And I set 'phoneNumber' field to "111222333"
#        When I send that GraphQL request as authorised user
#        Then I should receive a JSON response
